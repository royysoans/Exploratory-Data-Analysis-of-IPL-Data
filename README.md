# IPL Data Analysis – Ball-by-Ball IPL deliveries dataset

## Overview

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) ball-by-ball deliveries dataset.  
It aims to uncover key trends, top performers, and strategic insights for teams and players.  
The analysis includes runs, wickets, Powerplay & Death overs performance.  
Visualizations are created using Plotly.

## Objectives

- Clean and prepare the IPL deliveries dataset  
- Analyze player and team performances  
- Identify top batsmen & bowlers across different match phases  
- Discover patterns in Powerplay and Death overs  
- Present insights visually

## Problems Faced

- **Never done EDA before**  
  This was my first attempt at Exploratory Data Analysis, so understanding the requirements like data cleaning, grouping, and visualizing required extra research.

- **Lack of Cricket Knowledge**  
  I don’t follow cricket, so many terms like Powerplay and Death Overs were new to me. I had to spend time understanding the rules and phases of the game to interpret the data correctly.

- **New to Data Analysis Tools**  
  I had never used libraries like Pandas or Plotly before. Learning their syntax, functions, and how they work together for data cleaning and visualization was a challenge.

- **Misunderstanding Overs Structure**  
  I initially misunderstood how overs are indexed in the dataset (they start from 0, not 1). This messed up my initial filtering for Powerplay and Death overs.
